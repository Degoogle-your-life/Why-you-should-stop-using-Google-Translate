Notes for Google Translate article (February 23rd 2021)

Google Translates inaccuracy, and the dangers of some errors (not entirely Googles fault, as machine translation is so complicated that no-one has gotten it down to a science yet, but warnings should be in place)

Google Translate requires a Google account for history

Google Translate may have racist and sexist biases, judging by the method also being used for Google search, which has had these problems

Notable alternates: DeepL, Bing Translate, etc.
